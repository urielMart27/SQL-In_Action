PROBLEM 11: What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?

If you are renting, the factors of a successful AirBnb would be one with a high price and low availability. This is because that means most of the hotel is booked and you are maximizing the profit the higher the price is and the lower the availability is. The neighbourhood, room type, and minimum nights depend on what the buyer is looking for.
